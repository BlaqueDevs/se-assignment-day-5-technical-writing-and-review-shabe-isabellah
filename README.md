1.	For take experts. Do not oversimplify basic concepts , as they are already familiar with them. Facilitate discussions  and debates on technical issues. Focus on presenting data , statistics and technical results . Use technical jargon. For regular folks, explain the reasoning behind technical decisions and processes, rather than just the technical details. Encourage  questions and feedback. Use charts, graphs and diagrams to illustrate technical concepts. Avoid technical jargon .General tips for all audiences. Research your audiences background, interests and goals to tailor your communication accordingly. Use clear and concise language. Organise your information. Be patient and understanding of your audiences level of knowledge.
2.	Know your audience . Conduct thorough research to understand your target audience demographics and interests. Tailor your content through using language that resonates with your audiences level of expertise and familiarity with the topic .Adapt your message and delivery .Choose the right channels and platforms to reach your audience .
3.	Ask your audience directly about their existing knowledge and expectations before your presentation or meeting . If you have resented similar material before , review feedback to identify areas where people struggle with jargon concepts. Avoid technical terms and explain any necessary terms clearly. Adjust your communication style to suit the context and goals of the meeting. Pay attention to their questions and concerns , and adjust your message accordingly. Encourage audience participation and ask for feedback to gauge their understanding.
4.	Language and clarity . Define acronyms . Keep sentences short and to the point . Structure and  organization. Use headings and subheadings. Break down complex information into smaller , digestible chunks . Using bullet points. Use text , images, captions and audio descriptions. Test your content with users who have different technical skills and background to identify , potential accessibility issues.
5.	It maximizes reader comprehension by being clear and straightforward . It helps to express complex ideas in a simple and direct way, minimizing the use of jargon . It helps the target audience  to easily perceive information , avoid misunderstandings and save time . It builds trust with users because they can understand your call to action and complete tasks quickly.
6.	Use simple words and sentences so that the reader may understand the point  you are making. E.g. instead of saying ” The algorithm optimizes the parameters “, say “The program finds the best settings.”  Instead of saying “Utilize” say “Use”.
7.	Visuals and examples translate abstract ideas into concrete representations, making complex concepts more relatable and easier to understand. Visuals are more memorable than text, aiding in long term retention of information. Visuals can simplify complex ideas and data, making them more digestible and easier to compare and analyze. Visual communication such as charts and illustrations can bridge communication gaps and cater to diverse learning styles. Visuals can break down complex processes into easy to understand steps. 
8.	Processes and procedures. Flowcharts: excellent for visualizing step by step processes and decision making paths. Comparing data. Pie charts: best for showing parts of a whole, but should be used sparingly and only for simple compositions. Showing trends and relationships. Heat maps: efficiently represent data related to location or intensity such as areas of network congestion or frequency of errors. Visualizing numerical data. Waterfall charts: illustrate how an initial value changes overtime showing all intermediate changes.
9.	Headings and subheadings create a logical hierarchy, breaking down large blocks of texts into smaller, more manageable sections. This helps readers understand the flow of information and the relationships between different ideas. Heading act as signposts, allowing readers to quickly scan the document and locate specific information or sections of interest. This I especially important in technical documents, where readers may need to find answers to specific questions or follow particular procedures. By breaking up long paragraphs and providing visual cues, headings and subheadings make the document less intimidating and easier to read. This is crucial for ensuring that technical information is accessible and understandable to a wider audience. 
10.	Make headings and subheadings clear. Use short and descriptive headings. Your headings should clearly and concisely summarize the main topic of your page. Incorporate relevant keywords into your subheadings. Keep your headings consistent having the same colour and capitalization. Be creative in your subheadings. The subhead should always connect back to the main heading; this keeps the consistency and does not confuse the reader. Follow standard capitalization rules for headings and subheadings.
11.	The introduction should clearly and concisely inform users about the products purpose and main functionality. The name of the project or product you are presenting. A brief sentence that describes what the product does. A short list of the most important features. Who the product is for e.g. end users and developers. Why users should care or how the product benefits them.
12.	Start with two sentences that clearly explain what the product does and why it exists .Focus on the core problem it solves.  List three main features that set the product apart and matter most to the user.
